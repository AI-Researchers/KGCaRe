The most notable difference is in their gameplay mechanics and themes.\n\nPlateau, also known as \"The Game of the Goose,\" is a classic Italian board game. It's a simple race game where players move their pieces around the board according to the roll of the dice. The goal is to be the first player to reach the end of the board. There's not much strategy involved, and the game is largely based on luck.\n\nColt Express, on the other hand, is a more complex game with a Wild West theme. In Colt Express, players take on the roles of bandits robbing a train. The game involves programmed movement and actions, and players can shoot each other, move around the train cars, and collect loot. There's a significant amount of strategy involved, as players must decide the best course of action several turns in advance.\n\nSo, the main difference between the two games is that Plateau is a simple race game based on luck, while Colt Express is a more complex strategy game with a unique theme.","reasoning_chains":[],"ans_from":"LLM","prompt_template":"last_","intermediate_answer":{"Depth_1_Candidates":[["product category","Game","playing","strategic game","video game"],["game","Perfume's albums in chronological order"],["product category","Game","playing","strategic game","video game"]],"Depth_1_chain_of_entities":[["game","different from","Game"],["game","instance of","product category"],["game","different from","playing"]],"Depth_2_Candidates":[["product category","Game","playing","strategic game","video game"],["game","Perfume's albums in chronological order"],["product category","Game","playing","strategic game","video game"]],"Depth_2_chain_of_entities":[["Game","part of","Perfume's albums in chronological order"],["playing","different from","game"]],"Depth_3_Candidates":[["product category","Game","playing","strategic game","video game"],["game","Perfume's albums in chronological order"],["product category","Game","playing","strategic game","video game"]],"Depth_3_chain_of_entities":[["game","different from","Game"],["game","instance of","product category"],["game","different from","playing"]]}},{"id":"5a7cff5755429907fabef09d","question":"What was the title of the man who Sir Thomas Hungerford made his fortune working as a steward to?","gold_answer":"1st Duke of Lancaster","generated_answer":" The man who Sir Thomas Hungerford made his fortune working as a steward to was John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster.
