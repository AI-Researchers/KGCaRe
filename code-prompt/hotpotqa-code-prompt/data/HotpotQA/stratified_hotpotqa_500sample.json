                    " For example, in his 1987 edition of the play for the \"Contemporary Shakespeare\" series, A.L. Rowse writes; \"in the civilised Victorian age the play could not be performed because it could not be believed.",
                    " Such is the horror of our own age, with the appalling barbarities of prison camps and resistance movements paralleling the torture and mutilation and feeding on human flesh of the play, that it has ceased to be improbable.\"",
